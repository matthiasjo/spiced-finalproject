It was the realisation of a dream of our\n      founder, Janet, following her working at the Boldesti Public Shelter in\n      Romania. Janet and her husband Andrew have been supporting the amazing\n      work of Mădălina for quite some time. Mădălina is a volunteer at\n      Boldesti Public Shelter in Romania, and her love and dedication to feed,\n      care and save the lives of dogs is beyond incredible. Amongst many other\n      animals on their farm, Janet and Andrew have 5 dogs of their own\n      including two Boldesti boys and a female from another kill shelter. In\n      2017 Janet felt she could not could no longer just support the shelter\n      from afar and felt compelled to visit. Before setting off to Romania,\n      Janet raised funds by doing a ‘sponsored slim’ for her spaniel, Bella.\n      The funds raised from this were used to fund a 3-day spay clinic. The\n      trip to the Boldesti Shelter in Romania was life-changing for Janet, and\n      upon returning home, she quickly arranged for a mini-shelter to be built\n      so that some of the dogs she had met in Romania could be brought over\n      here to safety. Shortly after this, the first group of dogs arrived,\n      including Panda, Grace, Rose, Viola and Max. Sadly, Esme and Sweetpea\n      didn’t make it due to distemper, and this loss broke Janet’s heart, but\n      also motivated her to work even harder to save more lives. After the\n      first group of dogs found their forever homes, we fundraised to generate\n      enough to pay for the next group.\n    </p>\n    <h1>Our Mission</h1>\n    <p>\n      At DOGWAY, we believe that dogs are sentient beings, capable of feeling\n      \"human\" emotions such as fear, pain, joy, love and sorrow. Dogs provide\n      their human companions with unconditional love and absolute loyalty and\n      deserve to be treated as members of the family. We advocate for the\n      humane treatment of dogs worldwide. We believe that all dogs should be\n      treated with kindness and respect.\n    </p>\n    <h1>What We Do</h1>\n    <p>\n      Pets are at the heart of everything we do. Each year, thousands of cats,\n      dogs, small pets and horses turn to our animal hospitals, clinics and\n      rehoming services for treatment and to find them the happy homes they\n      deserve. Meanwhile, our Education and Behaviour Teams prepare future pet\n      owners to take responsibility and look after their pets for life.\n    </p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n",null]}
