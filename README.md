I had one week to come up with a final project idea and to realize it. We decided to do a group project to practice the github workflow and decided on Vue.js as framework because we worked with React, Redux and Socket.io in the previouse 3 weeks. We wanted to transfer this knowledge to Vue. Because of the limited time we decided to use Bootstrap in the frontend. 
This project is work in progress and will be continued. 

Feautres of this project:
- Photo upload on aws s3
- Use of google maps api
- Vuex state managment
- Email verification with nodemailer and node crypto
- User profiles and admin priviliges
- Search
- Comment function
