      <p>
        Our small dog rescue shelter is based in Harrogate, North Yorkshire and
        opened in November 2017. It was the realisation of a dream of our
        founder, Janet, following her working at the Boldesti Public Shelter in
        Romania. Janet and her husband Andrew have been supporting the amazing
        work of Mădălina for quite some time. Mădălina is a volunteer at
        Boldesti Public Shelter in Romania, and her love and dedication to feed,
        care and save the lives of dogs is beyond incredible. Amongst many other
        animals on their farm, Janet and Andrew have 5 dogs of their own
        including two Boldesti boys and a female from another kill shelter. In
        2017 Janet felt she could not could no longer just support the shelter
        from afar and felt compelled to visit. Before setting off to Romania,
        Janet raised funds by doing a ‘sponsored slim’ for her spaniel, Bella.
        The funds raised from this were used to fund a 3-day spay clinic. The
        trip to the Boldesti Shelter in Romania was life-changing for Janet, and
        upon returning home, she quickly arranged for a mini-shelter to be built
        so that some of the dogs she had met in Romania could be brought over
        here to safety. Shortly after this, the first group of dogs arrived,
        including Panda, Grace, Rose, Viola and Max. Sadly, Esme and Sweetpea
        didn’t make it due to distemper, and this loss broke Janet’s heart, but
        also motivated her to work even harder to save more lives. After the
        first group of dogs found their forever homes, we fundraised to generate
        enough to pay for the next group.

      <h1>Our Mission</h1>
      <p>
        At DOGWAY, we believe that dogs are sentient beings, capable of feeling
        "human" emotions such as fear, pain, joy, love and sorrow. Dogs provide
        their human companions with unconditional love and absolute loyalty and
        deserve to be treated as members of the family. We advocate for the
        humane treatment of dogs worldwide. We believe that all dogs should be
        treated with kindness and respect.
      </p>
      <h1>What We Do</h1>
      <p>
        Pets are at the heart of everything we do. Each year, thousands of cats,
        dogs, small pets and horses turn to our animal hospitals, clinics and
        rehoming services for treatment and to find them the happy homes they
        deserve. Meanwhile, our Education and Behaviour Teams prepare future pet
        owners to take responsibility and look after their pets for life.
